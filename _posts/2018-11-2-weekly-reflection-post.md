today is a weekly reflection day where we recap on this week and what the big idea of what we learned.

so this week was a blast where we learned about functions and contracts with how if one function works with another they make a contract. on thursday we started to learn about our functions for our video games and how they use in different ways like scaling and how not to use white backgrounds for images. on tuesday we learned about sting image and number like (circle 25 "solid" "blue") and "hello". the big idea is about functins and contracts with the fact that we could learn more next week and that we can do better at programming or as mr allatta cales it "coding art"
