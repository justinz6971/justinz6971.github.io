so this week we made our own program with wescheme and made flags with our coding with put-image:num num, and image. when we started the programing it was hard to do at first with how many images and numbers we had to put in. another hard thing is the functions with coding and that i had to do. i learned new things from mr.allatta and like how we can copy and function to another to make a flag or banner. when we did the flag i felt like i can create shapes and now to coding video games.
