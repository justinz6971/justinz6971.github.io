question: (example ( mystery "dog")3
(example (  mystery "cat") "kittens")
 which of the following examples have the same contract
 this question is asking if this has the same contract as the other contract. the correct answer is b because they have different things like kitten is string and 3 is a value and that the percentage is 75.9% for false so yeah its false.
 the next most chossen answer is a with a 23.1% on version 2 so yeah it mostly a nobrainer that its false.
