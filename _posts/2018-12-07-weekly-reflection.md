# part 1 - my flag.
this week we worked on our flag collage in order to see the dimensions of the flag and the colors of the flag. my flag is norway and its colors are red, blue, and white and the shapes are just rectangles. their are two different flags their the civil flag and the state and war flag which they both are simmilar but war flag at the end has triangle points that the rectangle shape of the civil flag.

# part 2 - questions and challenges.
the challenge that i had was the proportions of the flag into paper where i had to figure out how to make the flag the same as the proportions of the real flag. what i can do next time is to make sure that i could use rulers in order to figure ou the proportions of the flag that im am doing
