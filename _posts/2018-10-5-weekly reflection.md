today class was okay what we did today was about a flag project where we created a flag we wanted to create from any country and make it out of a colliage with construction paper and design the flag with it. we are learning in class with functions and verbs or math vocabulary and we got a worksheet with math functions and how to match which on is the right one. i didnt have any stuggles with the class this week because i fell like its easy leading up to the video game project which is going to use alot of coding.
