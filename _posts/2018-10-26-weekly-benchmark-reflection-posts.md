this week we did alot of things like making connect with other classes and started with our video game coding with defining variables and that we can do alot things with coding with defineng variables and making shapes, also that we had make expressions more constructive and also how we can make art and video games with coding and so much more with this. on monday we learned that defining variables makes art and on tuesday we learned about how to make video games with defining variables and on wednesday we learn to have function in define variables. the 1/3 of this semester was ok and that we had alot of fun with this class and i hope next class is great. this connect with math because of how we learned y and x coordinates which coding uses as well as functions and variables. we had made connections with other classes and how this could help with our designs for coding.
