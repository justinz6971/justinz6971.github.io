title:weekly reflection
date:11/9/18

this whole week was filled with new techniques like how to put function's with example and that they could make a difference when they can either be a example or define. the big idea is that we are starting to make our minds think more about how to make functions and definitions for our video game like today wher we learned that when a function dosen't have the right string then it wouldn't work. so this is the end of my weekly reflection.
