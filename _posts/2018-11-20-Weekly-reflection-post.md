![sonic the hedgehog](/images/download.png)




so this week was a short week but full of jam pack lessons like how to pu images into our learning blogs. so github takes images with this code !.[image].(/image/.png) which can tale any save image as and download files. my screen shot is on sonic the hedgehog where he is grabing a ring and a motobug is chasing after the ring so it a battle for who gets the ring. this is for famous or reconizable video game characters.
