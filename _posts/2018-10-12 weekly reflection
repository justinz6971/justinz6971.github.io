today what we did was we gave feedback to student who did their reflection and how they misspleled and with how they either made there long or too short. this was connected  to where we did the flag where i gave feed back on what to do with and how i fogot to put overlay to make the rectangles go inside the outline rectangle. what i learned today was how to code shapes and to make flag's of different contries and that i need sometime to do more but i can't wait until the video game project
